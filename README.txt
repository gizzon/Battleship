Application Programming in Java- Homework 3
Summer 2019

Battleship

Compilation and Execution Instructions:
	In order to compile + run the Battleship game, you must navigate to
	the appropriate directory and then run the "Builer.sh" file and then the
	"Runner.sh" file. Command-line arguments are not required, and the program
	will prompt you for input while it is running.


Input and Output Examples:
	The project file has a subfile labeled "boards." Within this folder there are
	9 board examples. Of the 9 examples, there are some boards that are labeled
	"invalid". These boards do not generate an output board because the formatting
	does not meet the required specifications. For board examples that have the
	correct formatting, such as "board10_1.txt", the game will run properly. The 
	number directly after "board" corresponds to the size of the board in that
	file.

Documentation:
	The JavaDoc has already been created and is in the files submitted. However,
	if you would like to run the generation of javadocs on your own, run the
	"JavaDocGen.sh" file.
